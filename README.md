# Collection of 3D Prints

I want to share some of my creations such that you can get inspired.

Creating models for a 3D printer is not that hard. I use [SketchUp](https://app.sketchup.com/app) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org) to do quick sketches of what I want to create. However, SketchUp and other free modeling software are either hard to learn or have many limitations. Therefore I sometimes also use [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) together with [`openpyscad`](https://github.com/taxpon/openpyscad), [SolidPython](https://github.com/SolidCode/SolidPython) such that I can code my creations. I have also found SDFs to be a great way to create smooth volumetric models, using a [SDF for Python](https://github.com/fogleman/sdf) library. This way I do not have any limitations and I get full control by using variables and other perks with programming, like for-loops and functions.

Recently, I have also had great success with using ChatGPT together with OpenSCAD and Blender.
