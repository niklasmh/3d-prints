# Attachment for a fake front for IKEA kitchen cabinets

I could not find any good solutions for attaching a fake front to an IKEA kitchen cabinet, so I made my own. This is a simple design that uses a 3D printed part to attach the fake front to the cabinet. The part is designed to fit the IKEA FAKTUM cabinet system, but it should work with other IKEA cabinets as well.
